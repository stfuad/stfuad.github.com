Loading a file from local disk:

1. Load a JSON file from local disk using File API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File).
2. Use FileReader (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) to read the resulting blob as text.
3. Use JSON.parse to parse into a JSON object.
4. Store the JSON object in window.localStorage. Using the character Name as the key. Or if Multiple characters store under the "Characters" key and have a input selection menu to select a character that persists with localStorage.

Saving to local disk:

1. Extract specific key or "Characters" key from window.localStorage into a variable.
2. Use JSON.stringify to change the JSON object into a text string.
3. Create a blob with the text string as the content and with a type of "application/json".
4. Create a URL object using the blob as the payload.
5. Create a link, a.download = $filename.json, a.href = the URL object.

Creating a character:

First the user needs to enter information into a character editer. Selecting a name, race, class level(s) and ability scores. Maybe age, height etc... Then save the character to localStorage as a JSON object, close the editor, load the JSON into a class to create a javascript object. Finally create the view functionally or via an ES5 Template.
